            IS的首领好像死了，在美军的交火中。
            姨粉设想的IS从西进入新疆打掉中共集中营，武装突厥人打一场叙利亚式的内战进而消耗维稳资源的设想估计要落空了。

            闲来无事，看了一下几个大牛的演讲，比尔盖茨 2007 年在哈佛的一个演讲，很值得听一听。下面是我的一点摘录：


            文字稿
            [https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/06/remarks-of-bill-gates-harvard-commencement-2007/](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/06/remarks-of-bill-gates-harvard-commencement-2007/)

            > I believe we have more caring than we know what to do with.

            > 

            > All of us here in this Yard, at one time or another, have seen
            human tragedies that broke our hearts, and yet we did nothing – not
            because we didn’t care, but because we didn’t know what to do. If we
            had known how to help, we would have acted.

            > 

            > The barrier to change is not too little caring; it is too much
            complexity.

            > 

            > To turn caring into action, we need to see a problem, see a
            solution, and see the impact. But complexity blocks all three steps.

            future is unpredictable... 不可预测的东西才值得我努力生活等待她的到来...
            额，有点太文艺了，不是我的风格...


            嗯，未来就是不用为了生存而奋斗；为了自我实现而写paper；想吃啥，马上就送货上门；想见什么人，带上眼镜就立刻沉浸；想去哪，嗖一下就见到了。嗯不错...


            最后加上世界和平：）
