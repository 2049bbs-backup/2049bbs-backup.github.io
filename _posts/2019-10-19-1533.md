            既然你阅读没问题了，那就突破障碍，逼自己写出来。可能会发现，其实你的写作水平比你想象的高。  
            我托福写作24/30分。考前没有连习过，只熟悉了题型，算半裸考。以前的"写作"经验也只限于少数网上留言。  
            不建议为了学英语而考托福之类。事实上，你英文好了，自然就可以高分；而反过来，你考高分，未必英文好。

            忘了说最重要的：我怎么学的。我从来没有"学"，纯粹把自己的网上活动全部变成英文的。在发现品葱,2049前，看中文内容的时间10%都没有。现在品葱失望了，可能也不再看了。

            Because of my laziness, I can't stop myself from using translation
            software in communications.  

            So I think taking a course may be useful. :( At least I will have a
            extenal motivation to leave the comfort zone.

            some minor mistakes, but not bad, good enough for online
            communication. not everyone in those English sites is a native
            English speaker, and no one cares that u speak imperfect English
            (mine isn't that good either). you should start doing it.

            There is indeed a silent phase in language learning where you need
            enough input (reading and listening) before obtaining the ability to
            output (writing and speaking).


            However, if you have already been able to read in-depth articles in
            English, but still find it hard to form sentences on your own, it is
            possible that you have not really learned the language the natural
            way.  

            What language do you \*\*think\*\* in?


            Is there a process of translation when you "use" English?


            Don't EVER translate. That's cheat. Build your language skills from
            scratch.

            @[懦夫斯基](/member/懦夫斯基) 7 Good point. he mentioned he had no problem
            reading '专业书', that doesn't mean knowing 'real English' - how real
            people speak. That's another reason not to use toefl/gre to learn
            english. Go speak with real people online instead.

            because I hate zhihu more than pincong.


            @[winblwrck](/member/winblwrck) 6


            OK  

            it makes me feel strange, but i'll try to make some eng posts every
            day.


            in fact, i'm not afraid of making mistakes during daily
            communication, but it's hard for me to logically present those
            complex topics, such as explaining a specific phenomenon in China,
            which really bothers me.


            @[懦夫斯基](/member/懦夫斯基) 7


            You're right. Because my school major is about some abstract things,
            so when i read those ENG books i don't really have to think in that
            way. All I need to do is translating some professional nouns within
            my mind.

            I might withhold my opinion on learning English online. Anyone that
            uses "lol" in RL always gives me a chill. Without an off-line
            environment for calibration, one wouldn't be able to tell the
            difference between internet slang, cultural slang, and proper daily
            use of language.


            If I may recommend a less conventional way, the film "King's Speech"
            could be a great source of inspiration. Think of oneself as an
            actor, a performer. Read a screenplay of one's favorite films and
            act it out. It might just provide the detachment needed to discard
            one's instinctive lean on their native language and translation.

            By 'online', I didn't mean only chatrooms/comment sections, there
            are tons of English resources online - youtube, wikipedia, news
            sites, tv shows, movies, etc.


            I recommend online resources because

            says he doesn't live in an English environment, which means talking
            to real English speakers may not be an option, so the internet is
            the next best option.

            I see. I probably got the wrong assumption from OP's mentioning of
            Reddit...  

            Now we're on the same page and I absolutely agree with you.

            我发现很多人会不会不自觉的把句子弄得自我复杂了？  

            比方说下面这个例子，我觉得尝试用短句子表达同个意思可以improve your writing immensely.  

            中式学英文，把句子弄得花俏是外行的做法。


            Because my school major is about some abstract things, so when i
            read those ENG books i don't really have to think in that way. All I
            need to do is translating some professional nouns within my mind.


            \-------->


            I majored in something abstract. As a result, I translated the
            terminnology without of thinking of it in the language when I read
            an English book.


            \--------->>


            I didn't have many chances to think as a native English speaker in
            college due to a science major.

            今天听楼主这么一说，才突然意识到原来学习语言的困难之处就在于咱这种“只会读不会说”的情况。回想每次考试的英语作文和简单的和外国人的一些交流，无一例外是先酝酿好中文再翻译过去的，跟直接以英文思考说出去的文字似乎蛮不一样的，似乎这就是语感上的地道差异？看来还是得在纯英文的环境里多待一些时间，边听边说才能真正学好英语……

            顺便问一下各位怎么提高阅读速度，以达到略读的境界。我现在能够做到最快的阅读只能比得上我最快的语速，属于默读在脑海中回声的低级阶段。读的时候脑海中倒是不会浮现出中文含义。

最近一直在Reddit等地方潜水，看NBA和HK相关的新闻，偶尔想打几个字去和别人交流，但却发现自己完全想不出话来，或者想说什么却没办法用英文流畅地表达自己的意思。感觉自己不借助Google Translate都不能好好说话了……  
阅读方面我倒是没太大障碍，以前大学时也能看英文的专业书，就是不会写作。  
所以说大家的英文表达都是怎么练习的呢？  
还是说我干脆去考个托福，GRE什么的……
